        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <section class="mission-content">
            Our mission is to curate an inclusive and supportive environment for educators of
            color by addressing systemic inequalities within the education system and providing resources
            for educators experiencing said inequalities. We have gathered information on several mentorship
            programs, public awareness campaigns, and helpful hiring practices as we aim to empower teachers of color,
            foster their professional growth, and enhance connections with students. By amplifying their voices and
            experiences, we strive to inspire meaningful change, recruit diverse educators, and build a more equitable future
            in PreK-12 education for all.
