            <p>The article, “ Our Stories, Our Struggles, and Our Strengths,” details Latino educators and their experiences in the field.
            It goes into depth about how Latino educators are often lumped together as one group despite being from different backgrounds,
            cultures, and countries. This can make it difficult to be seen as an individual in the field, as well as avoid stereotypes commonly
            put on the Latino community. The study done by Griffin shows Latino educator's strengths and how many thought back to their
            experience in school, seeing that they need to be there to advocate and be the voice of Latino students in the education system.
            This can help with the retention of Latino educators and while this is good, there should be more reasons for retention than the
            need to advocate. In the article, “Through Our Eyes: Perspectives and Reflections From Black Teachers”, the author details the
            challenges Black educators experience in the field, as well as the general underrepresentation of Black educators. Griffin and
            Tackie share several microaggressions Black teachers face such as, “teachers who related well to students, but had to “tone down”
            their personalities to be seen as professionals” (Griffin & Tackie, 2016). This leads to a similar feeling in Latino educators,
            where they again feel they are only staying for the students. Retention is difficult when teachers are constantly being stereotyped,
            generalized, and forced out of the field. Teachers of color are essential in the field of education and in one sample shared,
            students said they felt more comfortable in school and felt it was easier to build relationships due to the cultural connection with
            their teacher. While being able to empathize with students, Black teachers still struggle with devaluing, limited support, and
            biases in the workplace, and this ultimately leads to a high rate at which Black educators leave the field. The article
            “Please Hire More Teachers of Color: Challenged the “Good Enough” In Teacher Diversity Efforts,” is framed around the Critical
            Race Theory (CRT) which is defined as a theoretical framework that highlights the salience of racism as a key factor in 
            understanding inequity in education. With this, Thomas describes the importance of teacher diversity and that encourages it, 
            the institutionalized barriers need to be removed. Thomas used many qualitative methods in her research and showed different ways 
            teachers see their position. She details the support teachers need and prepares them for the struggles they will face. Teachers 
            of color are hard to recruit and retain and are often being under shadowed by the number of white teachers.We see this in a final 
            example in the article, “Changing the Narrative on Diversifying the Teaching Workforce…”, Andrews provides the example, “This is 
            critical given the number of communities across the country where Latinx, Indigenous, and Asian/Asian American students are the 
            numeric majority in their schools and the teaching staff is predominantly White" (Andrews, 7).This shows the difficult finding 
            teachers of color, and also how students may underperform due to the lack of comfortability.</p>
            <p>
                The article “Our Stories, Our Struggles, and Our Strengths” shares a study, “In Tucson, Arizona, for example, K-12 students 
                enrolled in a Mexican American studies program experienced higher test scores, better graduation and attendance rates, and 
                had better disciplinary records than those who did not participate” (Griffin, 2018). This advises the need to incorporate 
                and expand multiracial content into the school curriculum. It shows that an increase in multiracial content in schools can 
                lead to students performing better, which can also lead to a general desire to educate and teach. In the article, “Through 
                Our Eyes” Perspectives and Reflections From Black Teachers” Griffin and Tackie provide an example of implementing mentorship 
                programs where Black educators can be guided through the hardships and struggles faced to improve retention in teachers of 
                color. In the article, “Please Hire More Teachers of Color: Challenged the “Good Enough” In Teacher Diversity Efforts,” 
                Thomas details that the efforts in diversity hiring need to be reworked and refined. She does this in a district near her 
                and detailed it, “the hiring process was reworked to include a required written statement on diversity in the application, 
                a highly structured interview protocol that was mandated to be followed without deviation for every interview, and the 
                introduction of trained observers to sit in on interviews” (Thomas, 2020, 221). In the article, “Three buckets and eight 
                strategies: Recruiting, supporting, and retaining a racially diverse special education teacher workforce,” LaRon A. Scott and 
                William Proffitt share the three-bucket strategy which is composed of recruitment, support, and retention. The strategies 
                consist of the implementation of anti-racist missions, vision statements, and assorted pathway programs. Furthermore, in 
                order to recruit teachers of color, the financial struggle must be addressed. A way in which we can help support these teachers 
                is by assisting future educators with the financial aid they need. Ultimately, these options provide great details of how to 
                promote teacher retention and recruitment and show how they affected the areas so positively.
