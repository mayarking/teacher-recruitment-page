                    a child’s school experience. In order for students to be able to perform well academically and be culturally aware, schools
                    must be racially diverse. Because of that, schools must fix the way that they are recruiting and retaining their teachers of
                    color. Recruitment and Retaining tips are included in the document for school personnel to follow. Further, the document encourages
                    education stakeholders to take action on the issue of recruiting, hiring, and retaining teachers of color by starting a conversation.</p>
